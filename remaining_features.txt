features to design:

-form component for 
	-- inserting a (pending invoice)
	-- creating a draft invoice (which can have empty fields [and no validation??] )
	-- editing

	++ validation errors

	** challengingParts: calendar, conditional display

- dark theme (update colors to be variables)
- confirm deletion modal

- design the display of the filter modal
- tablet design
-mobile desing



**** maybe I can edit the internal state of the invoice, and upon submit validate the data if it is a draft invoice, and then submit it to app.js

**** for an edit, I would have to populate the state with data passed down from the app invoices page (id parameter to filter?)
